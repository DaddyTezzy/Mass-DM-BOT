# MASS-DM BOT
By: Tezzy

## SELF-INSTALLING/HOSTING
- Download zip & extract to your desired path.
- Make sure your bot has presence intent ON, if not, configure it through [Discord Developer Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Go to your application that has your bot and go to bot section and turn on both **Privileged Gateway Intents** like the following image:

- Put your bot token in `config.json` line 2 (which you can find via [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/))
- Put your bot prefix in `config.json` line 3 which can be anything.
- Lastly, run `launch.bat` file and you are good to go!

## MASS-DM COMMANDS:
- {prefix}massdm MESSAGE:
- MassDM a custom message in a guild the command is ran in.
- {prefix}massdmall MESSAGE:
- MassDM in all servers the bot is in (command can be ran anywhere).

## LEGALITY
- This is highly against [Discord ToS](https://discord.com/terms).
- I don't take no responsibility for what your account or bot might face after using this tool as I do not promote the use of my tools.
- **Note** that this isn't my original mdm bot, I created this in like 5-8 mins just cause I wanted to upload something in here.
- - If you use this tool or find the work somewhat helpful, please make sure to star or fork the repository as that'll keep me somewhat motivated to upload more.
- If you're having any issues, ig you can contact me on cord.
- Enjoy<3
